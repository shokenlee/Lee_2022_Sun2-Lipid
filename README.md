# Lee et al. 2022

Custom scripts for image analysis performed in Lee et al. 2022.

Written in ImageJ Macro and Python (Jupyter Notebook).

Two sets of codes for measuring:
- NE enrichment score
- Protein abundance in nucleus area (e.g. Sun2)

## NE enrichment score

Performed in **Figure 1**. Image anaylysis was performed by ImageJ Macro as depicted below:

Then, the resulting spreadsheets were concatenated and further analyzed using the Python code.

## Protein abundacne in nucleus area (e.g. Sun2)

Performed in **Figures 2 and S2**. Staining intensity of the protein of interest within nucleus area was measured by ImageJ Macro. Nucleus are was defined using StarDist plugin. Then, the resulting spreadsheets were concatenated and further analyzed using the Python code.
